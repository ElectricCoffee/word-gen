* Word-Gen, a Word Generator for Rust.

** Premise

Word-Gen is a library for randomly generating words.

You give it a set of symbols and a set of rules for how to supply these symbols, and out pops a brand new randomly generated word!

The rules are written as a regex-like expression a-la =CVVC=, where =C= and =V= are sets of symbols, in this case Consonants and Vowels, and out pop words like "bear", "reef", "feed", "road", and even non-words like "biiq" and "qius".

The library is set to support the following operations:

- =[abc]=: alternatives
- =(abc)=: grouping
- =a?=: optionals
- =a*=: 0 or more
- =a+=: 1 or more

More might get added as need be.

Note that since this isn't meant to be actual regular expressions, =()= will not perform capturing.
